# mizzourahmd

The goal of mizzourahmd is to provide a clean and pretty rmarkdown template (I 
don't like any of the default themes).

## Installation

You can install the released version of mizzourahmd Github with:

``` r
## install from github
remotes::install_github("mkearney/mizzourahmd")
```

## Example

Here are a couple screen shots of the output:
